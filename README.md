## <a name="abstract"></a>ðŸ“Ž Abstract
>Visible-thermal image fusion is vital for unmanned aerial vehicle to achieve intelligent applications. However, existing fusion methods mainly rely on extracted inherent modality features without explicit attention to cross-modality discrepancies and effective feature enhancement mechanisms, critically limiting fusion performance. To address these issues, a novel discrepancy-guided visible-thermal image fusion (DGFusion) is introduced for UAV. Specifically, a dedicated amplitude-phase feature enhancer is introduced, augmenting inherent modality features in order to reinforce global information while preserving local clarity. Additionally, an innovative discrepancy-aware feature extractor is presented to highlight critical modality-discrepancy cues while filtering out irrelevant noise. Besides, an adaptive discrepancy-guided feature fusion is proposed to integrate both enhanced and discrepant features, enabling stable fusion results under dynamic UAV conditions. A new dataset comprising 8700 pairs of visible-thermal images captured from a UAV perspective and covering diverse challenging scenarios is established to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed fusion method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DGFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both fusion quality and robust performance.
